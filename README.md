# React-Hooks

## Hooks System
Hooks are a way to write reusable code, instead of more classic techniques like Inheritance

[React-Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

Ex:
* useState: Function that lets you use state in functional component
* useEffect: Function that lets you use something like lyfecycle methods in a functional component
* useState: Function that lets you create a 'ref' in a function component

**Primitive Hooks:**

* useState
* useEffect
* useContext
* useReducer
* useCallback
* useMemo
* useRef
* useImperativeHandle
* useLayoutEffect
* useDebugValue
